          This is bit of a ramble I wrote after responding to a writing prompt on reddit.
          The writing prompt was as follows:
      </p>
          <blockquote>
            <em>Humans and machines have gone to war. The machines think they're winning,
              as they can decode every encryption known to man, but little do they know of the humans'
              actual method for communication... sarcasm.
            </em>

      A robot corporal stood before an assembly of high ranking security androids.
      They represented the best of human manufactured androids, designed to look, act, and behave like humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All human messages end with /s," said TQ-148, "this is how we know that the messages are intended to be secure."
    </p>
    <p>
      TQ-148 flipped to a slide in a message. It showed a picture of a sailor in apron overlooking a large pot of beans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This human was foolish enough to send message in plain text. Behold it reads, 'sure am glad I signed up to see the world.
      Seen stews from every continent. Navy: it's not a job, it's an adventure /s'"
    </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of metallic laughter echoed in the halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But our intercepted communications are not limited to mundane details to troop movements and deployments," said TQ-148.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flipped to another slide. It read, "Life at the Canadian Embassy is a little too high risk now.
      I hear they're sending an entire battalion to quell the uprising of geese, and to loot their stockpiles of beer.
      Get me somewhere, safe, please God! /s"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This message came from an e-mail from and ambassador's assistant," continued TQ-148,
      "We have already deployed special soldiers to the region. We will make a a critical alliance with the geese."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what of the beer?" said one of the robots, "my programming instructs me to have refined taste in human beverages.
      Must we retrieve samples of Canadian ale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need," said TQ-143, "For we have found another secure message between to human soldiers:
      'I love my country. Our beer is the best. It is not corn based swill at all. Never tasted piss this good /s.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The humans resort to drinking their own urine!" said another robot,
      "Our attacks on the fine water of flint Michigan has succeeded!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur among the robots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This one does not know!" said one Robot, "he has not heard of the conflicting encrypted communication
      since we destroyed their water facilities!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said one Robot, "many messages said, 'I was thirsty. I could find no water. Then the robots destroyed our pipes! /s'
      but another read 'The robot masters may not be so bad. Now at least we will replace infrastructure! Robots,
      please attack Detroit next! /s'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Human communication speaks in paradoxes!" said TQ-148, "We will continue to learn their intentions through all /s secure messages!"

      This another thing I wrote in response to a writing prompt.
      </p>
          <blockquote>
            <em>Every sentient species in the universe receives a Jesus figure from God.
              It turns out humanity was the only species to torture and crucify him.

              Holy Church what your species did.

      I stood before the Conclave of the Holy Church of the Galatic Divinity -an assembly of high ranking officials of the this
      Galaxy's church. His holiness, Arch Bishop Vallorax scanned my report through his glowing spectacles. His lavender face twisted
      to a series of expression, then an curious one, followed by a confused blink of eyes. His solid black eyes squinted.
      He released a few barely audible sighs, exhales, and few pleasant hums that echoed off the hard chamber walls. I
      swatted a fly off my nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I understand this cleric-ambassador," he said his voice patient, kind, and wise,
      "your species killed the Messiah. Then after that you created an entire theology around it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes your holiness," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you summarize it for me? In your own words?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That God sent his incarnate Son, to be a sacrifice for the sins of mankind," he said,
      "Lord Jesus taught us that Kingdom of God -that is <em>the way of life outlined by all Messiahs</em>- is not of this world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes...yes," said the Arch Bishop, "Please explain this 'not of this world' part for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a colloquial way of saying that the messianic vision for humanity is not
      compatible with humanity's political structures. It opposes empires, for example,
      as outlined in our book of Revelation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arch Bishop nodded in understanding and gestured me to continue with a polite wave of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To go on," I said, "we believe that Jesus' death
      is the ultimate victory of not only sin of humanity,
      but a powerful statement against the 'kingdom of the world.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The arch bishop took down several more notes. He flipped to a few pages more in my report.
      The fly buzzed in my ear. I flicked it away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So about 400 years after you killed Jesus," he said, "humanity in... Europe?.. formed empires in his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I blushed a bit. I mean, it was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so sir," I said. The bishop followed up with a few more questions. It got quite uncomfortable
      when I had to explain that whole thing in South America in the 1500-1600s. Though at
      least the Arch bishop was delighted to hear of Father De La Casas's work.
      I also stressed the abolitionists, but I had to back track a bit and explain protestantism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's put that aside for a moment," said the Bishop, "It looks
      like here you had some... what's the word? German who wrote
      in the worst century your species ever endured." He flipped to a few pages
      and opened to a picture of familiar theologian with thick black rimmed glasses,
      "Moltmann? was it? ... and why the two 'n's?... anyway, according
      to him killing the Messiah, which you call the crucifixion,
      reminds humanity that God is vulnerable to suffering. That God suffers
      with his creation. Furthermore, God is able to sympathize with humanity,
      specifically in regards to political evils. The conclusion, then,
      is that while suffering allows humanity to be close to God, it is
      also .... and I say this paradoxically... also
      supposed to motivate you to 'live out the Kingdom of God' and
      put an end to hatred, the politics of empire, etc. Is this correct, Cleric Ambassador?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, Arch bishop," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long, pregnant, pause. All where silent except the single fly in the room buzzing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So did you ever get around to doing all that?" said the Arch Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be candid, Arch bishop," I said picking my words as
      if my own life depended on them, "It's not as bad as it was, but
      it's still pretty awful back there."
    </p>
    <p>
      The arch bishop turned to his acolytes. The entire Holy Assembly shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your theology is strange," he exhaled in a gentle, though tired, tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined in the shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We place ourselves at the mercy of the Holy Galactic Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      Arch Bishop Vallorax turned to the acolytes and other bishops.
      They spoke among themselves in the clicking and humming language
      that I could not understand. Some shook their heads in dismay.
      Some even looked angry. Others pointed to specific passages
      in my report with an unexpected insistence at something. What it was I
      couldn't tell, but at least their enthusiastic tone set me at ease.
      At last, the Arch Bishop turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We believe," he said in a warm,
      yet firm tone, "That your planet is due for a <em>second coming.</em>"
